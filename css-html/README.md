# Kiddom Code Test: CSS/HTML

So, our fancy new 500-error page came back and doesn't look quite right...

The banner image is either too tall, pushing the content off the page, or too narrow, leaving gutters at the side. 

We don't want the message text pushed down below, and also don't think it looks right with the text laid on top of the image. 

*Challenge is:* Get the banner image to stretch to 100% width, but also not occupy more than 1/3 of the screen height -- without editing the jpg.

*Instructions:* Please fork this repo, branch, commit, and pull request your response.
